# SharePoint-ReportingApp
There are 2 modules in this Excel VBA/VBScript SharePoint-Reporting App. The first module will pull the MS Access Web Database's tables on SharePoint into an MS Excel spreadsheet. The second module will perform reporting functions such as querying the imported tables into the spreadsheet and producing ad-hoc dataset. Those datasets then serve as a source for pivot tables reports. The pivot tables are the reports the end-user interacts with in this application.

Note: This spreadsheet application can function remotely without having to be connected to the Access Web Database to perform its reporting functions. All the data that is maintained on the Access Web Db tables are replicated in this Excel spreadsheet application.
